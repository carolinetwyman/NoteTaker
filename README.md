## Description
This is an app that allows you to take notes, and save them in one place. 

First, add a title in your note, the title is what will appear when saved.

Then, populate the note body.

Save each note by clicking the saveIcon (icon from Font Awesome).

This is how the notes appear when saved.

When you're done with a note, you can delete it by clicking the trash icon (and what icons aren't, these days).
